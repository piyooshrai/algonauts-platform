# Algonaut Vision

## One Sentence

Algonaut is the data layer that proves whether a fresher will succeed at a job, built on proprietary assessment data, trained by Indian scale, designed for acquisition.

## The Problem We Solve

### For Students
- Empty resumes, no way to prove capability
- College brand is only signal (unfair to Tier 2/3)
- Spray and pray applications (demoralizing)
- No feedback on why they're rejected

### For Companies
- Entry-level hiring is a coin flip
- Resumes are fiction
- College brand is proxy but unreliable
- Bad hires cost 6 months of productivity

### For the Market
- LinkedIn doesn't work for freshers (no experience to show)
- Existing platforms are job boards, not matching engines
- No one has solved skill verification at scale
- No one has closed the loop on outcomes

## Our Thesis

**Prediction is the product.**

Not job listings. Not profiles. Not applications.

The ability to say with 80% accuracy:
> "This student will succeed at this job and stay 90+ days"

That's worth more than all the job boards combined.

## Why India First

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| Volume | 10M+ freshers/year = fastest learning |
| Homogeneity | Similar education system = cleaner signal |
| Engagement | High anxiety = high engagement = more data |
| Feedback loops | Placements are public = ground truth available |
| Cost | Lower CAC = can afford exploration |
| Competition | Local players have data but no ML sophistication |

India is the training ground. The model transfers globally.

## The Data Moat

### What We Accumulate

```
LAYER 1: Assessment Data
├── LayersRank scores for every student
├── Detailed breakdown (technical, aptitude, communication)
├── Proctoring signals (behavior patterns)
└── Question-level performance

LAYER 2: Behavioral Data
├── Every click, view, application
├── Time patterns
├── Response to notifications
└── Engagement depth

LAYER 3: Outcome Data (THE GOLD)
├── Application → Interview conversion
├── Interview → Offer conversion
├── Offer → Acceptance conversion
├── 30-day retention
├── 90-day retention
└── Job performance (future: employer feedback)
```

### Why This Can't Be Replicated

```
LinkedIn has: 100M users in India
LinkedIn doesn't have:
├── Verified skill assessments tied to outcomes
├── Proctored assessment behavioral data
├── 90-day placement retention tracking
├── Closed-loop outcome correlation
└── 3 years of accumulated learning

You can't buy this data. You have to earn it over time.
```

## The Acquisition Thesis

### Why LinkedIn Buys Us

1. **They've failed at freshers 3 times**
   - LinkedIn Students (shut down)
   - LinkedIn Campus (underperforming)
   - Skills Assessments (low adoption)

2. **We have what they can't build**
   - Proprietary assessment data
   - Outcome-correlated predictions
   - College relationships
   - RL models trained on real placements

3. **The math works**
   - Entry-level is $50B+ market globally
   - Our prediction accuracy = 2-3x better than alternatives
   - Worth paying premium to buy vs build

### The Target Metrics

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 (Exit) |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Students | 100K | 500K | 2M |
| Assessments | 50K | 250K | 1M |
| Placements (verified) | 10K | 50K | 200K |
| 90-day verified | 5K | 30K | 150K |
| Prediction accuracy | 60% | 70% | 78%+ |
| College partnerships | 100 | 300 | 500 |
| ARR | $500K | $3M | $15M |
| Acquirer interest | Watching | Conversations | Acquisition |

## The Unfair Advantages

### 1. LayersRank
- Proctored, AI-driven assessment
- Behavioral signals (keystrokes, face, patterns)
- Already built, needs integration
- IP that transfers with acquisition

### 2. Outcome Tracking
- 30-day and 90-day verification
- Ground truth for model training
- No one else does this systematically
- Compounds over time

### 3. Game Theory Mechanics
- Psychology-driven engagement
- Indian context optimization
- Higher engagement = more data
- More data = better models

### 4. RL Architecture
- Learning from every interaction
- Models improve automatically
- India scale = fast learning
- Defensible technical moat

---

## What We're NOT

- NOT a job board with better UX
- NOT a LinkedIn clone for freshers
- NOT dependent on company relationships
- NOT a features play

We are a **data and prediction company** disguised as a job platform.

## Exit Scenarios

### Scenario A: LinkedIn Acquisition (Primary)
- Timeline: Year 3-4
- Price: $150-300M (15-20x ARR + strategic premium)
- Why: Fills their entry-level gap globally

### Scenario B: InfoEdge/Naukri Acquisition
- Timeline: Year 2-3
- Price: $80-150M
- Why: Defensive, protect India market

### Scenario C: EdTech Acquisition (Coursera, etc.)
- Timeline: Year 3-4
- Price: $100-200M
- Why: Assessment IP + student distribution

### Scenario D: Strategic Buyer (TCS, Infosys, etc.)
- Timeline: Year 2-3
- Price: $50-100M
- Why: Captive hiring pipeline

### Scenario E: IPO
- Timeline: Year 5+
- Outcome: $500M-1B valuation
- Why: Dominant market position, proven unit economics

## The Core Bet

We bet that:

1. Skill assessment CAN predict job success
2. Behavioral data improves prediction
3. Outcome tracking creates defensible moat
4. Indian scale enables fastest learning
5. Game theory drives engagement needed for data
6. LinkedIn (or similar) will pay premium for solved problem

If all six are true: $200M+ exit in 3-4 years.
If some are true: $50-100M exit or sustainable business.
If none are true: Pivot or shut down.

The first 12 months prove or disprove the core bet.
